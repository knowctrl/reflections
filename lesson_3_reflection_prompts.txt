When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When other people are also contributing to the project and as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Another user may have made changes that you are not aware of and you don't
want a pull to erase the work you have done.
