When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

When other people are also contributing to the project and as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Another user may have made changes that you are not aware of and you don't
want a pull to erase the work you have done.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are clones of a repository located on GitHub. This would be used when
you want to make changes but don't have permissions to change the repository.
Clones are duplicates of repositories located locally and remotely. This would
be used when you want to change the repository. Branches are a way to make
changes to a repository without losing the original content.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Having a locally stored copy allows you to work off-line and compare changes
made to the online repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Use email to collaborate without using Git or GitHub. It would be easier
short-term, for small repositories, in that no one would have to learn how to
use Git or GitHub. Long-term and for large or complex repositories, it would be
more difficult to track change history and find conflicts.
